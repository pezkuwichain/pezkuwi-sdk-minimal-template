# Runtime

ℹ️ The runtime (in other words, a state transition function), refers to the core logic of the blockchain that is
responsible for validating blocks and executing the state changes they define.

💁 The runtime in this template is constructed using ready-made FRAME pallets that ship with
[Pezkuwi SDK](https://github.com/pezkuwichain/pezkuwi-sdk), and a [template for a custom pallet](../pezpallets/README.md).
